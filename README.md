# rock-paper-scissors

This is [The Odin's Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Rock-Paper-Scissors project from its Foundation course.

This project's goal is to practice using Javascript to play the game against the computer in the browser console.

In the rules of this game:

* Rock beats Scissors
* Scissors beats Paper
* Paper beats Rock

The game prompts the user to choose Rock, Paper or Scissors. The computer's choice is randomly generated.

A game consists of five rounds of Rock, Paper, Scissors but if there's a tie, another round is played to determine a definitive winner.

At the end, the game declares the winner and the score.
